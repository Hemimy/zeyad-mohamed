        <p>HTML is an abbreviation for HyperText Markup Language.<br> It is the first and main language in the front-end development track, which is responsible for the main structure of any website. <br>It is not considered as a programming language.
        </p>
        <p>
            The commands in this language are in tags <code>&lt;   &gt;</code> containing elements. Some elements contain attributes.<br> The difference between those definitions is that whatever is in the tags are elements but everything but the main word or command is an attribute. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>&lt; img src= "hello.png" &gt;</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The tag is: <code>&lt; img src= "hello.png" &gt;</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The element is: <code>img src= "hello.png"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The attribute is: <code>src= "hello.png"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Some tags have an opening and closing, while others do not. This is according to whether the tag contains content or is content. In the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, it is content, while in the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag it contains content.
